# v4.1.0
- feat: Consumer return code [#21](https://github.com/cody-greene/node-rabbitmq-client/pull/21)

# v4.0.0
BREAKING CHANGES:
- dropped node 14 (EOL 2023-04-30)
- `MethodParams` is indexed by an enum rather than a string, e.g.
  `MethodParams['basic.ack'] -> MethodParams[Cmd.BasicAck]`
- removed `nowait` from type definitions
- fixed typo on exported type def: RPCCLient -> RPCClient

Features:
- Rename `Publisher.publish() -> .send()` and `RPCClient.publish() -> .send()`
  the old method still exists as an alias, for now (deprecated)
- Added a few method overloads for: basicPublish, basicCancel, queueDeclare,
  queueDelete, queuePurge
- Documentation improvements: more examples, clarifications
- RPCClient supports retries `new RPCClient({maxAttempts: 2})`
- Better stack traces. When `Publisher#send()` fails, due to an undeclared
  exchange for example, the stack trace now includes your application code,
  rather than the async internals of this library.
